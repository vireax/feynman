## This translation

I'm not sure if translating this book will violate any copyright law. I see Feynman's personality is unique, he delivered his lecture in simple words, and we don't have this kind of book in Khmer language. I gain no money from this one man band project. Not many people is going to complete this translation for free because other than English, technical knowledge is very required. So, it will simply takes me years to finish the translation.
